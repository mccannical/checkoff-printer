      "spritz of avocado oil",
      "3 large navel oranges, cut into chunks (peeled with a knife, pith removed)",
      "a small wedge of purple cabbage, finely shredded or pulsed in a food processor (about 2 cups)",
      "\u00bd cup chopped cilantro",
      "a small wedge of red onion, minced (about 1/4 cup)",
      "1-2 tablespoons olive oil or avocado oil",
      "juice of 2 limes (2-3 tablespoons)",
      "half of a jalape\u00f1o (ribs and seeds removed)",

    "instructions": "Make Orange Salsa\nToss all ingredients together except oranges; massage with your hands to soften the cabbage a bit. (You\u2019ll add the oranges until right before serving, so they don\u2019t turn pink.)\nMake Aji Verde\nBlend the aji verde sauce until smooth.\nPrep Salmon:\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees; place a rack near the top. Pat salmon dry with paper towels. Place on a sheet pan lined with parchment (I just leave the filets in one whole piece). Mix seasoning for salmon; coat salmon filets with seasoning. Spritz with a light coating avocado oil.\nBake Salmon\nBake for 5 minutes near the top of the oven. Then broil another 4-6 minutes until cooked to your liking (I like it to be medium, about 135 degrees).\nServe\nAdd oranges to the slaw mixture. Put rice and aji verde side by side on the bottom of a plate or shallow bowl. Then flake a few chunks of salmon on top, and finish with a scoop of the salsa. Chef\u2019s kiss!",

Whisk egg mixture; pour directly onto the sheet pan with the veggies. Bake for 7 minutes.\nBake\nPush the eggs gently around on the pan until \u201cscrambled\u201d a bit (they should still be a bit wet). Return to oven for 3-6 minutes until they\u2019re set.\nBurritos\nFill tortillas with the egg mixture, refried beans, smoked gouda cheese, and cilantro. Wrap snugly in the tortilla, and roll it up in foil.\nStore\nFrom here, you can freeze them for up to 3 months, or keep them in the fridge for 3-4 days. See notes for reheating methods! Serve with salsa and/or chipotle sauce.\nOptions for Reheating:\nMicrowave\nUnwrap burrito (frozen or thawed) and place on a microwave safe plate. Microwave for 2-3 minutes. I flip it over halfway through to get it heated more evenly.\nOven\nBake the foil-wrapped burrito at 425 for 30 minutes (25-30 for thawed, 35-40 if still frozen). As long as it\u2019s in the foil, you can just put it directly on an oven rack. I do this while I\u2019m getting ready and then it\u2019s steamy and warmed for me to eat just before I leave!\nAir Fryer or Skillet (for crispiness)\nSpritz the outside of the burrito with oil and air fry at 350 for 4 minutes. For a skillet, pan fry in a skillet over medium heat with some butter for 2 minutes per side until golden. This can be done with a warmed OR frozen burrito \u2013 in either case, it will make the exterior crispy. If you do it with a frozen burrito, you might need to give it an additional 1-2 minutes in the microwave to ensure it\u2019s heated through after crisping.",

    "ingredients": [
      "8 tablespoons of salted butter",
      "1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture)",
      "1/4 cup packed light brown sugar",
      "1 teaspoon vanilla",
      "1 egg",
      "1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces)",
      "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra)",
      "3/4 cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks)"
    ],
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn\u2019t be hot \u2013 but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.\nUsing a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated \u2013 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).\nAdd the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between \u201cwet\u201d dough and \u201cdry\u201d dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.\nRoll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they\u2019re not done yet (see picture in the post). They\u2019ll be pale and puffy.\nLet them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.",

Add the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente\u2014edible but still a little firm to the bite. Drain the pasta through a colander. Toss with a little olive oil so the pasta does not stick together while you make the sauce.\nBrown the meat: While the water is heating in the previous step, start on the sauce. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, add the bulk sausage or ground meat. Break up any large chunks of sausage as it cooks. Brown well. Don't stir that often or it will be more difficult for the meat to brown. If you are using ground beef or pork instead of sausage, sprinkle with a little salt.\nMake the sauce: When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions and stir well to combine. Saut\u00e9 everything until the onions are translucent and beginning to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Cook 1 minute, then add the tomato sauce and stir well. Bring to a simmer. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper, if needed.\nAssemble the casserole: Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole pan, then dot the surface with half the ricotta cheese. Ladle a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, stir it well and then add the pasta into the casserole. Pour the rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese over the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese. At this point, you can cool, cover, and refrigerate or freeze to make ahead.\nBake: Bake uncovered in the oven at 350\u00b0F until the top is lightly browned and the cheese melted, about 20 to 25 minutes.

If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time. Simply Recipes / Cambrea Gordon\nAdd the ground beef, then the Worcestershire sauce and broth: Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Drain the pan of excess fat, if necessary (anything more than 1 tablespoon). Season with salt and pepper. Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out. Taste the cooked filling and, if needed, add more salt, pepper, Worcestershire, or other seasonings of your choice. Simply Recipes / Cambrea GordonSimply Recipes / Cambrea Gordon\nMash the cooked potatoes: When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, taste, and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Simply Recipes / Cambrea Gordon\nLayer the meat mixture and mashed potatoes in a casserole dish: Spread the cooked filling in an even layer in a large baking dish (such as a 9 x 13-inch casserole. Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes. Simply Recipes / Cambrea GordonSimply Recipes / Cambrea Gordon\nBake: Place in a 400\u00b0F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown. (Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.)

      "6 large red or yellow onions (about 3 pounds), peeled and thinly sliced root to stem (see How to Slice an Onion), about 10 cups of sliced onions total",
      "4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil",
      "2 tablespoons butter",

      "2 bay leaves",
      "1 tablespoon (loose) of fresh thyme (can also use a few sprigs of fresh thyme) OR 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme (more to taste)",
      "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
      "2 tablespoons brandy (optional)",
      "8 slices French bread or baguette cut 1-inch thick",
      "1 1/2 cups of grated Swiss Gruyere and a sprinkling of Parmesan",
      "Sprinkling of Parmesan"
    ],
    "instructions": "Peel and slice the onions: Peel and thinly slice the onions from root to stem. There should be about 10 cups of sliced onions in total. Simply Recipes / Cambrea Bakes\nBegin caramelizing the onions with olive oil and butter: In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive oil. Cook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the butter and cook, stirring often, until the onions start to brown, about 20 to 40 minutes. The amount of time will vary depending on your pot, stove, and onions. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer\nSprinkle with the sugar, finish caramelizing, and add garlic: Sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon of salt. Continue to cook until the onions are well browned, about 10 to 15 more minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer\nDeglaze the pot with vermouth or wine: Add the wine or vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on the bottom and sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer\nAdd the stock, bay leaves, and thyme: Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes. Simply Recipes / Elise BauerSimply Recipes / Elise Bauer\nSeason and add the brandy: Season to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper. Discard the bay leaves. Add brandy if using.\nToast the French bread slices: While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil and preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Brush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly with olive oil (you'll end up using about a tablespoon and a half of olive oil for this). Put in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven. Simply Recipes / Elise BauerSimply Recipes / Elise Bauer Turn the toasts over and sprinkle with the grated Gruyere cheese and Parmesan. Return to oven when it's close to serving time and bake until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.\nServe: To serve, ladle soup into a bowl and transfer one cheesy toast onto the top of each bowl of soup. Alternatively, you can use individual oven-proof bowls or one large casserole dish. Ladle the soup into the bowls or casserole dish. Cover with the toast and sprinkle with cheese. Put into the broiler for 10 minutes at 350\u00b0 F, or until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned. Did you enjoy this recipe? Let us know with a rating and review!",

    "instructions": "Proof the yeast: Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive. (Note that if you are using \"instant yeast\" instead of \"active yeast\", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)\nMake and knead the pizza dough: Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7 to 10 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand. The dough should be a little sticky or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.\nLet the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F) for 1 1/2 hours. For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours). The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.",

Place a roasting pan or heavy duty baking sheet (one that can take high heat) in the oven to preheat.\nPeel and cut the sweet potatoes into wedges: Peel the sweet potatoes and cut off the ends. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then, if they are very long, in half crosswise. Cut each piece into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick wedges. Alternately, you can slice the peeled sweet potato into disks either with a mandoline or a sharp knife. Simply Recipes / Eliezer MartinezSimply Recipes / Eliezer Martinez\nToss with the oil, salt, spices: Put the sweet potatoes into a large bowl and add the oil. Mix well to combine. Sprinkle with salt and spices of your choice. Use your hands to mix well, so all pieces are coated with oil and spices. Simply Recipes / Eliezer Martinez\nSpread onto preheated pan: Remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Carefully spread the sweet potatoes out in a single layer on the baking sheet. (Watch out, the pan is hot!) Simply Recipes / Eliezer Martinez\nBake: Bake for 15 to 25 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and use tongs to turn over all of the sweet potato pieces. Return to the oven and bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, or until they are well browned. Cooking time depends on the temperature of the oven (500\u00b0F will need less cooking time than 450\u00b0F) and the size and thinness of the sweet potato wedges. The browner they are, the crispier they will be, but there is a fine line between browned and burnt beyond edibility. Even if they get really dark, they should still be good because of the natural sugars of the sweet potatoes caramelizing. So watch carefully.

(See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.) Place in a bowl.\nMash the avocado flesh: Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.\nAdd the remaining ingredients to taste: Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice. The acid in the lime juice will provide some balance to the richness of the avocado and will help delay the avocados from turning brown. Add the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper, and chilis. Chili peppers vary individually in their spiciness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add more to the guacamole to your desired degree of heat. Remember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.\nServe immediately: If making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down to cover it to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.) Garnish with slices of red radish or jicama strips. Serve with your choice of store-bought tortilla chips or make your own homemade tortilla chips. Refrigerate leftover guacamole up to 3 days. Note: Chilling tomatoes dulls their flavor. So, if you want to add chopped tomato to your guacamole, add just before serving. Did you love the recipe? Let us know with a rating and review!",

    "title": "Perfect Mashed Potatoes",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 1/2 pounds (680 g) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into quarters",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",
      "4 tablespoons (60 ml) heavy cream",
      "2 tablespoons (30 g) butter",
      "1 tablespoon milk (or more)",
      "Salt and pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": "Cook the potatoes: Place the peeled and cut potatoes into a medium saucepan. Add cold water to the pan until the potatoes are covered by at least 1 inch. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the water. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cover. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until you can easily poke through the potatoes with a fork. Simply Recipes / Annika PanikkerSimply Recipes / Annika PanikkerSimply Recipes / Annika Panikker\nHeat the butter and cream: While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter and warm the cream together in a pan on the stove or in the microwave. Simply Recipes / Annika Panikker\nDrain and mash the potatoes: When the potatoes are done, drain the water and place the steaming hot potatoes into a large bowl. Pour the heated cream and melted butter over the potatoes, along with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Then use a strong wooden spoon (a metal spoon might bend) to beat further. Add milk and beat until the mashed potatoes are smooth. Don't over-beat the potatoes or the mashed potatoes will end up gluey. Taste, then season as needed with salt and pepper. Did you love the recipe? Give us some stars and leave a comment below!

    "title": "Perfect Popcorn",
    "ingredients": [
      "3 tablespoons coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil",
      "1/3 cup of high quality popcorn kernels",
      "1 Tbsp or more (to taste) of butter (optional)",
      "Salt to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": "Heat the oil: Heat the oil in a 3-quart thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high heat. If you are using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt.\nPut 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil: Wait for the popcorn kernels to pop.\nAdd the rest of the popcorn: When the kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer\nCover the pot, remove from heat and count 30 seconds: (Count out loud! It's fun to do with kids.) This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at about the same time.\nReturn the pan to the heat: The popcorn should begin popping soon, and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner. As the popcorn pops, try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let the steam from the popcorn release (the popcorn will be drier and crisper and less tough).\nOnce the popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the pan from the heat: Remove the lid and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl. With this technique, nearly all of the kernels pop, and nothing burns.\nMelt butter in the empty hot pan: If you are adding butter, you can easily melt it by placing the butter in the now empty, but hot pan. If you let the butter get just a little bit brown, it will add an even more intense, buttery flavor to the butter and to your popcorn. Just drizzle the melted butter over the popcorn and toss to distribute.\nSprinkle the popcorn with salt to taste: Fun toppings for the popcorn: Spanish smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, cayenne powder, chili pepper, curry powder, cumin, grated Parmesan cheese.

    "title": "Pasta Carbonara",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter",
      "1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced",
      "1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)",
      "3-4 whole eggs",
      "1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese",
      "1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)",
      "Salt and black pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": "Heat the pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)\nSaut\u00e9 the pancetta or bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy. Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.\nBeat the eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.\nCook the pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.\nToss the pasta with pancetta or bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water. Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce. Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)\nAdd the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out. Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.Did you enjoy this recipe? Let us know with a rating and review!
